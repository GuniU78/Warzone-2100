Origins
-------

Warzone 2100, released in 1999 and developed by Pumpkin Studios, was a
ground-breaking and innovative 3D real-time strategy game.

In 2004 Eidos, in collaboration with Pumpkin Studios, decided to release
the source for the game under the terms of the GNU GPL, including everything
but the music and in-game video sequences, which were released later.

State of the game
-----------------

After the liberation of the Warzone 2100 source-code on December 6th, 2004, all
proprietary technologies have been replaced with open-source counterparts.

Right now supported platforms are Linux, Windows, and macOS. There are reports
that Warzone 2100 is working on BSD, too.
